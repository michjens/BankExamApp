# BankApp
KEA Bank android app

By Michael Kongsgaard Jensen


A Banking app that allows the user to Transfer money, Pay bills, Apply for new Accounts, Update user info and more.


Both Login authentication/account creation & database logic is handled by Google Firebase.


To test the App simply run the program and create a user. It will not have any money in the bank by default, but all functionality will still work, and you're able to apply for additional accounts.
